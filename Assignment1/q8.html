    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first paragraph. It is indented using four non-breaking spaces, which creates a visible space at the beginning of the paragraph. This indentation is commonly used in web pages to improve the text layout and make it visually more appealing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second paragraph. Just like the first one, it is indented with four non-breaking spaces. This method of indentation is used in HTML when we want to ensure that the spacing remains consistent and does not collapse like regular spaces do.</p>
